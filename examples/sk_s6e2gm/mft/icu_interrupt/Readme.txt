Description

This example demonstrates ICU capture function with interrupt. 
A pulse generated by a GPIO is input to the ICU input pin.

================================================================================
How To Use This Code Example 

* Use the Debug build in the project file
* Build and download the example to the board
* Connect P34 to the specified Icu input pin (For example, connect P34 to P35/IC02_0 
  in this sample project.) 
* Rebuild and run the program.  
* Watch the Terminal I/O window (Debug viewer).

Note:
* The printf content can be output to UART0 (SOT0_0). This is enabled by 
  DEBUG_PRINT definition in the pdl_user.h. You can disable the output to the 
  terminal by removing DEBUG_PRINT definition from the pdl_user.h
   
================================================================================
Terminal window setup

Establish a connection to the board using your preferred terminal software. Each 
terminal program has its own user interface, we assume you are familiar with how
to change settings. This code example requires these settings for the connection.
- Port: specify the serial port in use
- Baud rate: 115200
- Data: 8 bit
- Parity: none
- Stop bit: 1
- Flow control: none

================================================================================
